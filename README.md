# Naive-Bayes-and-Logistic-Regression

Naive Bayes and MCAP Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes 
1. Run the program NaiveBayes.py with the following command
2. python NaiveBayes.py <useStopWords>
3. useStopWords can be entered as yes or no, if no is entered => then stop words are skipped. 

Logistic Regression
1. Run the program LogisticRegression.py with the following command
2. python LogisticRegression.py <useStopWords> <learningRate> <numberOfIterations> <lambda>
3. useStopWords can be entered as yes or no, if no is entered => stop words are skipped
4. learningRate - enter any value (0.1 is preferred), for learning the weights
5. numberOfIterations - enter any value (10 is preferred) for the iterations for learning using batch gradient ascent
6. lambda - enter any value (0.1,0.01,0.001, ..) for L2 regularization
